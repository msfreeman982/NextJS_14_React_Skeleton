                Using the term "free labor" might refer to unpaid internships or contributing to open-source projects
                without financial compensation. While contributing to open source is a common and valuable practice in
                the programming community, it's essential to recognize that skilled work deserves fair compensation.
                Unpaid internships have faced scrutiny for potentially exploiting workers.

                In general, fair compensation for skilled labor is encouraged, and many programmers advocate for fair
                wages and ethical practices within the tech industry.
